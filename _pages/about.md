I am a second-year Economic History PhD student in the [Centre for Economics, Policy and History](https://ceph.ie/), an all-Ireland centre of excellence funded by the Higher Education Authority, linking Trinity College Dublin and Queen's University Belfast. My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematical (Bayesian) statistics, applied probability, and machine learning. I am currently completing doctoral-level coursework and pursuing research with professors [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/), [Stephen Walker](https://www.ma.utexas.edu/component/cobalt/item/15-mathematics/385-walker-stephen-g?Itemid=1259) and [Alessandro Rinaldo](https://arinaldo.github.io/). For the first and second year of my graduate studies, I am fortunate to be sponsored by the Bank of Italy's ["Giorgio Mortara" scholarship](https://www.bancaditalia.it/chi-siamo/lavorare-bi/borse-di-studio/stringher-mortara-menichella/).

Before moving to Belfast, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's studies at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home) in Milan, Italy. While a visiting student at the [Dondena Centre for Research on Social Dynamics and Public Policy](https://dondena.unibocconi.eu/?_gl=1*oh71bi*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTYxODc1NTA1Mi4xNzI3ODc1ODEz*_ga_GXEKQ9VXGW*MTcyNzg3NTgxMi4xLjAuMTcyNzg3NTgxMi4wLjAuMA..), I was also part of the European Research Grant [SMITE Project](https://dondena.unibocconi.eu/research-projects/smite) team, led by professor [Guido Alfani](https://guidoalfani.eu/).
