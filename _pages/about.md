Welcome to my webpage! I am a second-year Economic History PhD student at [Queen's University Belfast](https://www.qub.ac.uk/), financed by the [Centre for Economics, Policy and History](https://ceph.ie/), an all-Ireland centre of excellence funded by the Higher Education Authority, linking Trinity College Dublin and Queen's University Belfast. My research project investigates apprenticeship and labour markets in late medieval and early modern Northern Italy. This research aims at contributing to a better understanding of the dynamics behind skills acquisition in early modern Europe and the consequences on long-term economic growth.
For my doctoral research I am supervised by [Prof. John Turner](https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/queens-business-school/people/academic-staff/AllAcademicStaffProfiles/Turner.html) and [Dr. Arcangelo Dimico](https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/queens-business-school/people/academic-staff/AllAcademicStaffProfiles/Dimico.html).

Before moving to Belfast, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's studies at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home) in Milan, Italy. While a visiting student at the [Dondena Centre for Research on Social Dynamics and Public Policy](https://dondena.unibocconi.eu/?_gl=1*oh71bi*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTYxODc1NTA1Mi4xNzI3ODc1ODEz*_ga_GXEKQ9VXGW*MTcyNzg3NTgxMi4xLjAuMTcyNzg3NTgxMi4wLjAuMA..), I was also part of the European Research Grant [SMITE Project](https://dondena.unibocconi.eu/research-projects/smite) team, led by professor [Guido Alfani](https://guidoalfani.eu/).
