- Networks paving the way: apprenticeship and occupational mobility in early modern Genoa
    <details class="abstract">
    <summary> [Abstract]</summary>
    <p><em>
      The functioning of pre-industrial labour markets remains an area of ongoing scholarly debate. Using a dataset of 8,000 apprenticeship contracts drafted in Genoa between 1450 and 1530, this paper examines how social networks shaped labour market outcomes and provides three main insights. First, social networks, particularly the presence of family ties with masters and guild members, structured the entry of apprentices into skilled occupations and significantly increased their chances of becoming masters after training. Second, individuals with family ties to guild members benefited from favourable conditions throughout their professional careers, ultimately improving their labour market outcomes and restricting access to opportunities for those without such connections. Third, the segmentation of the urban labour market confirms that apprenticeship was only a limited source of opportunities for upward occupational mobility in Italian labour markets.

- Asymmetric shocks in pre-industrial labour markets: evidence from the 1630-1631 plague in Venice
  <details class="abstract">
    <summary> [Abstract]</summary>
    <p><em>
      This paper examines how the 1630-31 plague affected apprenticeship wages in Venice, offering new evidence on how pre-industrial labour markets adjusted to large demographic shocks. Using a dataset of more than 17,000 apprenticeship contracts, I reconstruct wage trends before and after the epidemic and compare outcomes across skilled and unskilled trades. Real wages rose in the aftermath of the plague, but the increase was significantly larger in skill-intensive trades, where training was longer and human capital harder to replace. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, I estimate a post-plague skilled wage premium of 12-14 percent, which is robust to controls for contract structure, in-kind payments, and recruitment patterns. These findings suggest that, contrary to the equalizing effects often attributed to the Black Death, the 1630-31 plague reinforced wage hierarchies and entrenched labour market stratification.
